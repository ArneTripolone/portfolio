This repository contains Arne Tripolone’s portfolio website. This is created with HTML and CSS covered in the Bootcamp so far. 
Most of the design was sourced from You-Tube Chanel ‘Going-To Internet’ and their video ‘How To Create A Complete Personal Portfolio Website Just using HTML And CSS | Pure HTML And CS’ (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgRENOnSCxE). 
This was one of the few sources I found which provided a template which didn’t involve JSS or other tech not yet covered in the coding bootcamp. 
The contact form was adapted from w3schools - https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_contact_form.asp . 

Most of the acceptance criteria has been fulfilled, except for initial application images appearing larger which I was unable to figure out. 
One of the biggest challenges with creating this website was image sizing and their backgrounds. 
I was hoping to attach an image without a background, but this didn’t seem to be possible for me. 
Another challenge was accepting the size of the css file which seems to be bigger than Ben Our, although it wasn’t possible for me to reduce it.
