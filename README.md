### Updated Page 1/8/21
Originally this repository featured my portfolio website created purely with  HTML and CSS. After feedback + trial and error, I decided it would be best to undergo a complete overhaul and implement a CSS framework - Bootstrap. This greatly enhanced the responsiveness of the site, allowed for striking visuals (for instance the work example carousel) and elegant button configuration in the contact page. Bootstrap also necessitated far less code than HTML and CSS alone, offering a tidier representation of my work which I am happy to link on my various social media accounts.

### Description
This repo contains a Web Development portfolio for Arne Tripolone. I have tried to achieve a  minimalist look with content justified to the left, facilitating ease of reading. There are 5 main sections: Navigation Bar, Jumbotron, About Me, Work Examples and Contact Me. 

*Section Features*
- Navigation Bar: internal links to other sections and collapsible below medium size
- Jumbotron: features a profile image of me that stays in the left hand corner on page resize.
- About Me: a brief overview of my position in web development. This will need to be detailed into a proper summary in time.
- Work Examples: 3 web development work examples (a group project and 2 individual projects). These are organised in a carousel to provide some interactivity for the user. Images are styled with reduced opacity to encourage users to click on the repository links.
- Contact Me: 5 ways users can interact with me, including by LinkedIn, GitHub, email, phone, or by downloading my web development CV.
